			<title>First post!</title>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I decided to start a new blog. I&amp;#39;ve been blogging previously, but not really in a technical context. My previous blog was focused on politics, economics and society. Although I&amp;#39;m still interested in those topics, I feel more like writing up some technical stuff now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what am I going to write about? Probably quite a few different things. I&amp;#39;m planning on telling you about my experiences - both previous and current - with differente programming languages, methods, archicture and projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I&amp;#39;m working on a Proof of Concept project using Python for prototyping and exploring the domain of the concept. That&amp;#39;ll probably be the first thing to get its own post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Until then!&lt;/p&gt;
