Welcome to the *Dependency What?* workshop. My name is Thomas Presthus, and I've been working as a consultant doing software development and architecture for the past ten years.

This workshop premieres at the NNUG Vestfold KodekafÃ©. That means that you, dear participant, is one of the first people to ever take part in it. Since this is the premiere, I ask of you to please raise any questions or problems you may encounter on your path here tonight. I further hope that we won't exceed our time slot. Furthermore I'd like to thank Verftet for hosting us - please take the opportunity to order yourself a coffee or beer to show our gratitude.

Now for the fun part! What is this workshop all about? I'd say it's mainly about the Dependency Inversion Principle, but with bits thrown in about Inversion of Control, containers (not the docker/LXC ones!) and Dependency Injection as well. (Big words, I know!)

I've found throughout the past years that while many developers kinda understands the principles behind these words, many also struggle to explain the difference between them and perhaps also to implement them in actual code.

That's why we'll try to break down the principles and approaches to implementing them, and hopefully giving a little more insight to how they help us and our codebases. 

## Prerequisities

Since this workshop is hosted by NNUG Vestfold, we'll use C# as our language of choice in code samples and excercises. The principles and patterns we present should, however, apply to most object-oriented languages. Most of them applies to functional languages as well, but those tend to have other mechanisms that might be more idiomatic (see e.g. my [blog post on Scala and the Cake Pattern](http://www.ballofcode.com/scala/ioc/cake-pattern/2014/01/26/scala-cake-pattern.html)).

You should have a functioning development environment of your choice (e.g. Visual Studio or perhaps vim and mono?). You should also have a basic understanding of object orientation.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 101

What is the Dependency Inversion Principle (hereafter known as *DIP*)?

The principle itself was probably first described by Robert "Uncle Bob" Martin along with the [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)).

It states:

> A. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
> 
> B. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

Simple enough, right? Read it again and try to dig into its actual meaning. Abstractions should not depend on details. What are these details and abstractions?

In object orientation we create abstractions and concrete implementations in order to modularize and reason about our systems. It's not always easy to come up with helpful implementations though. Consider the following example:

{% highlight csharp %}

interface IClient
{
    string FirstName { get; set; }
    string LastName { get; set; }
    IList<Address> Addresses { get; set; }

    void Activate();
    void Deactivate(string reason);

    void AddAccount(IAccount account);
    
    void Deposit(double amount);
}

{% endhighlight %}

Interfaces in C# are one kind of abstractions. They define an interface that other types can implement, and thus signal their supported operations to their consumers.

Is the above code a good abstraction though? While, yes, it's an interface and not a concrete implementation, it seems to offer nor abstraction. It's rather a means of indirection.

So what would we consider a good abstraction? We would have to abstract something away, right? Let me give you an example.

My car has automatic transmission, meaning that I don't have to manually shift gears. When I think of automatic transmission, this is what I envision:

![Shifter](../../images/shifter.jpg)

This is however what an automatic transmission actually looks like:

![Automatic transmission](../../images/transmission.jpg)

<small>Picture by Abdullah AlBargan under Creative Commons [CC BY-ND 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/)</small>

See how the first image, the **shifter**, abstracts away how the automatic transmission works? Imagine the interface describing the actual transmission!

That's probably pretty easy. Don't worry though, we'll get to more complex abstractions in a little while.

What does this abstraction give us? First of all, it's an interface that would seem natural and comprehendible by any driver. Like the driver, the abstraction would make sense to a coder trying to use your interface - allowing him not to worry about how the underlying machinery actually works.

By now you might be wondering what automatic transmissions has to do with the **DIP**. There are no dependencies in the code yet. Let's revisit the principle briefly: Code should depend on things that are at the same or higher level of abstractions.

We can draw this: ![](../../images/dependency-what/ishifter-eightspeed.png)

Notice that the IShifter abstraction has do depencies while the EightSpeedTransmission, by implementing it, has a dependency on IShifter.

Let's extend our system by adding a *Driver*: ![](../../images/dependency-what/driver-ishifter-eightspeed.png)

Notice how we now introduce another *detail*, *Driver*. The Driver has a dependency on *IShifter*. This adheres to the **DIP** since we have no abstractions depending on details. Both details are depending on an abstraction.

We could, of course, have made our Driver depend directly on the EightSpeedTransmission instead, but this would violate the **DIP**.

> ### Excercise
>
> Implement the above type system in your favorite language

That about wraps up the chapter on Dependency Inversion Principle. This far we've learned that it's in fact a very simple principle that helps us create modularized and loosely coupled code by not having details depend on details.
