Recently I decided to start a new blog. I've been blogging previously, but not really in a technical context. My previous blog was focused on politics, economics and society. Although I'm still interested in those topics, I feel more like writing up some technical stuff now.

So what am I going to write about? Probably quite a few different things. I'm planning on telling you about my experiences - both previous and current - with differente programming languages, methods, archicture and projects.

Right now I'm working on a Proof of Concept project using Python for prototyping and exploring the domain of the concept. That'll probably be the first thing to get its own post.

Until then!
