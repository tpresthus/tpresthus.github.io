In May I had the honour of presenting my "But what about the UI"-talk at µCon London 2019. This is a talk where I explore different patterns and strategies for composing user interfaces in distributed systems, like a microservice architecture. I had a great time delivering the talk - albeit I ran out of time and had to rush through some of the more beefy slides.

You can see the recording, and slides, [of the presentation here](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/13526-but-what-about-the-ui). Signing up is free, and you get to watch all the other great talks from the conference as well!

Ever since developers started breaking applications into services, be it in the era of SOA or more recently with microservices, they’ve struggled to incorporate user interfaces into their decoupled, distributed architectures.

We’ve all seen frontends versioned separately with tight coupling to dependent services, breaking cohesion. The rise of Backend-For-Frontend is real and so is the emerge of micro frontends. We all talk about composition, yet so many projects fail to implement actual composition. The result seem to be some kind of compromise proving hard to scale when multiple teams are involved - causing lock-step deployment, latency, bottlenecks and coordination issues.

What if you could find a viable solution that allowed you to scale development, keep distribution and cohesion and also provide composition of user interfaces?

This talk explores the different patterns available, and attempts to pinpoint their pros and cons, effectively serving as guidance to implementing proper composition. Thomas will go beyond the simple “Hello World” example that always seems to work, and you’ll learn patterns in modelling and designing that can actually be employed for composition.
