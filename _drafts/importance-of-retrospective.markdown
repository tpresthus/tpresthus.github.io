The retrospective is maybe one of the most overlooked artifacts of agile processes
like SCRUM. I'll try to outline the downsides of skipping it entirely, as well
as the pitfalls of ineffective and boring retros, before trying to lay down
some guidance based on my own experiences.

## Skipping the retrospective

If you've ever worked on a SCRUM team, I'm pretty sure that you can list several
occasions when someone decided that the retrospective will be skipped for the
current sprint. The reasons are many, but often it's due to a deadline coming up,
or because it's impossible to book a free conference room - or because more than
a few members of the team are off on holiday.

Whatever the reason, skipping one retrospective quickly spirals down to several
retros being skipped. Before you know it, it's been 4-5 sprints since the last
one.

In order to determine the downsides of skipping the retrospective we'll start by
outlining what a retrospective is - and why we keep doing it.

### The retrospective

The retrospective, or retro for short, is a meeting where the entire team gathers
to discuss the sprint that we've just finished.

During the retro we establish a collective understanding of what went down, what
turned out to be a good idea, and what we'd rather prevent from happening again.

See, agile is all about feedback. We work in sprints in order to get near-instant
feedback from our business on the product or service we're building. We see
feedback as valuable, because it allows us to change course and heading, to make
adjustments and build our product as aligned to the business as possible.

Being agile, however, isn't all about the product we're building. It's about
being more agile than our surroundings (being other teams, departments, the
entire organization or our competitors). Being agile involves more than user
stories, planning meetings and demos. It's actually an extremely valuable
opportunity to grant ourselves a better and more happy way of working.

When coaching an agile team, I usually like to bring forward some common
bullet points in the retrospective. I don't tend to use them all in one meeting,
but select a few that I feel are relevant:

  - How long was our current sprint?
  - Should it be this long? Shorter?
  - Did we have standups every day?
  - Do we need to keep having standups?
  - How did our user stories work out?
  - Did anyone feel like they were missing out?
  - Do we have a ubiquitous understanding of the road ahead?
  - Did we get to communicate with the parties we needed to?
  - Was the planning meeting okay, or did we struggle to plan the sprint?
  - What are our biggest concerns and upcoming impediments?
  - If we made a change to our process; how did it turn out? Do we want to keep the change, discard it, or alter it?

The list really goes on and on, and there's no standardized list because it
depends so heavily on the team and the organization surrounding it.

As you hopefully can see, though, these questions welcomes discussions around
the way we worked the past sprint. I often find that teams have a very fixed
idea about many of the artifacts involved in especially SCRUM.

> Our sprints last for 3 weeks because that's what the other teams do.

SCRUM teams are usually advised to keep their sprint to 2-4 weeks. This doesn't
mean that you should just pick a duration and stick to it. Sure, you have to
pick a length for your first sprint. But depending on the team, its size and
the organization it belongs to, you'll often find that the length of the sprint
becomes an impediment. It's harder to plan a long sprint than a short one. On the
other hand, shorter sprints come with more overhead. What's the best length then?
It varies. It varies from team to team, but it also varies for a given team over time.
I usually find that shorter sprints are good when starting a new project, and
longer sprints fit better as the project matures. But again, it depends. And the
only way to find out is to experiment. And **evaluate**. This is what you do during
the retro!

> We had daily standups, but they felt like a waste of time since we talk to
> each other all the time during the work day.

Daily SCRUM, or standups, are great catalizators for communication. Many teams
depend on them for their coordination and communication - especially if the team is
distributed. But some teams communicate perfectly well without a standup. So
should you keep doing standups? It depends. Experiment. **Evaluate**. This is what
you do during the retro!

> And so on

Suffice to say, the retrospective is about feedback on the sprint and process itself,
as opposed to feedback on the product and functionality we're building.

### Back on track

Now that we have a shared understanding of what the retrospective is, let's explore
what happens when we skip it.
